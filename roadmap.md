# The Great Simplification
The ambitions for Dungeons of Arvum were a little too large when I started, so I will be working on splitting these different functions into two game modes:

## Battle Royale
A classic battle royale inspired by all the popular games.
This means something like 5 different weapons, all available in different rarity types with different strengths.
3 spells.
But same weapon.
No armor, just shield.
Leveling is still in the game, but different rarities will now dictate, so e.g.
level 5 unlocks strong items, level 10 unlocks epic.
No respawns ever.

## Roguelike Royale
Roguelike Royale will be a lot more complicated, and the games should be considerably longer.
20-30 different weapons, 5-10 different spells, armor + shield, buffs and debuffs.
A much steeper learning curve, but potentially much more rewarding gameplay.
Monster death respawns through certain items, no player death respawn.
Items are locked to levels not based on rarity, but individually.

The following is the old roadmap from back in the day.
Still relevant, but not the focus atm.
The following are major updates and changes coming to Dungeons of Arvum in the future.

# The Spell Update
*Status*: Active

The spell update is already in progress, and wants to overhaul the way spells work.
At first, I thought it would be nice for the players to have loads of different spells to learn, and so I added a lot of different spell scrolls (that you learn spells from).
In playtesting, this turned out to be a bad idea.
It's too complicated.
So, now there's going to be three different spell branches.
You can read more on the thoughts regarding these branches in the wiki.

# The Combat Update
*Status*: Pending

Combat works relatively fine in Dungeons of Arvum.
But, you can shoot through walls, and oftentimes a tick occurs right when you attack, so a mob moves outside of your radius without you being able to tell beforehand.
This might waste mana and ammo.
Mobs will also often hug you, and just stand really close to you without attacking you.
These things will be fixed by this update.

# The Content Update
*Status*: Pending

A lot of items have no price.
Monsters have random HP and damage.
Weapons are wildly inconsistent.
A lot of more content is going to be added, monsters, items, shops and characters.
And all this will have to be balanced.
It's going to be great!
